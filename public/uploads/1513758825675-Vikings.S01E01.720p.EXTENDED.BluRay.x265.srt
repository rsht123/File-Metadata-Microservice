1
00:00:49,634 --> 00:00:50,635
Ragnar!

2
00:02:30,235 --> 00:02:31,277
<i>Odin!</i>

3
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:05,562
Ragnar!

4
00:04:40,365 --> 00:04:41,950
Come on.
Let's go home.

5
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:51,542
Watch.

6
00:05:22,991 --> 00:05:24,617
What are you two doing?

7
00:05:25,785 --> 00:05:28,663
I'm taking Bjorn to the thing tomorrow.

8
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:34,544
Not yet.
He's not old enough.

9
00:05:34,627 --> 00:05:36,421
He's 12 years old.

10
00:05:36,504 --> 00:05:37,880
Take him next year.

11
00:05:37,964 --> 00:05:39,632
Next year is soon enough.

12
00:05:40,258 --> 00:05:42,802
He'll need a silk ribbon, Lagertha.

13
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:48,349
You're a handsome boy.

14
00:05:49,225 --> 00:05:50,685
Funny ears, though.

15
00:05:57,066 --> 00:05:59,986
Don't sleep with lots of women in Kattegat.

16
00:06:00,695 --> 00:06:02,947
I can do without it for a few days.

17
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:07,785
Is that another way of saying you love me?

18
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:11,873
Huh?

19
00:06:12,123 --> 00:06:13,791
I always dream of you.

20
00:06:15,543 --> 00:06:18,921
Last night, I dreamt you were feeding me blood pudding.

21
00:06:21,758 --> 00:06:23,342
What does that mean?

22
00:06:24,135 --> 00:06:26,763
It means you're giving me your heart.

23
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:39,859
Get your dog, boy.

24
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:42,153
Frodi!
Come on, boy.

25
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,170
What will happen
at the thing?

26
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:02,423
The Earl will deal with some criminal offenses,

27
00:07:02,507 --> 00:07:04,842
and then, we'll discuss the summer raids.

28
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:07,929
And where will you go?

29
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:09,889
The Earl decides.

30
00:07:10,098 --> 00:07:11,599
He owns the ships.

31
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:15,603
He'll send us to the east,

32
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:17,605
as always, to the Baltic lands,

33
00:07:18,815 --> 00:07:20,942
but I want to know
what's to the west.

34
00:07:21,025 --> 00:07:23,361
What cities and gods are over there.

35
00:07:24,112 --> 00:07:26,030
See, I'm not satisfied

36
00:07:27,031 --> 00:07:28,616
with this.

37
00:07:33,496 --> 00:07:36,707
Odin gave his eye
to acquire knowledge,

38
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:41,254
but I would give far more.

39
00:07:46,134 --> 00:07:48,719
And will Earl Haraldson let you?

40
00:07:53,057 --> 00:07:54,600
Good.

41
00:07:55,685 --> 00:07:59,480
Like this, nice and tight.

42
00:07:59,814 --> 00:08:01,440
And on three.

43
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:04,735
One, two, three.

44
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:08,322
Very good, Gyda.

45
00:08:14,162 --> 00:08:16,080
Gyda, feed the goats.

46
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:19,417
Go on!

47
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,088
What do you want?

48
00:08:24,172 --> 00:08:25,840
We know you're all alone here.

49
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:27,758
All the men are gone.

50
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:31,929
If you're thirsty, I will give you a drink.

51
00:08:32,138 --> 00:08:34,390
If you're hungry,
I will feed you.

52
00:08:34,557 --> 00:08:36,809
Otherwise, you must go.

53
00:08:37,268 --> 00:08:41,147
We will eat and drink
after we've satisfied our other needs.

54
00:08:53,117 --> 00:08:55,203
I don't want to kill you, woman.

55
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,956
You couldn't kill me if you tried for 100 years.

56
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,352
Out!

57
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:29,737
Gyda!

58
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,207
Gyda.

59
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:47,171
I went
to confess my love to her,

60
00:09:47,672 --> 00:09:49,382
but I was set upon by a bear

61
00:09:49,465 --> 00:09:52,718
and an enormous hound
who guarded her home.

62
00:09:53,678 --> 00:09:56,931
I killed the bear
with my spear,

63
00:09:58,349 --> 00:10:01,560
and I managed to strangle the hound with my bare hands.

64
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:07,525
And that is how I gained her hand in marriage.

65
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:11,404
Did she tell you
the same story?

66
00:10:14,073 --> 00:10:15,533
Just about.

67
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:27,128
Are you ready to receive
your arm ring and become a man?

68
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:28,963
Yes.

69
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:30,631
And what does a man do?

70
00:10:32,675 --> 00:10:34,010
He fights.

71
00:10:34,427 --> 00:10:35,511
And?

72
00:10:36,721 --> 00:10:39,056
He looks after his family.

73
00:10:39,974 --> 00:10:41,392
That's right.

74
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:44,228
Could you look after our family?

75
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,443
What do you mean?
You look after us.

76
00:10:50,526 --> 00:10:52,111
Say I wasn't there.

77
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:56,866
I have a big decision to make.

78
00:10:57,742 --> 00:10:59,952
It may change many things.

79
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:06,125
Now, go to sleep.
You have a big day tomorrow.

80
00:12:33,671 --> 00:12:35,339
Bjorn!

81
00:12:37,967 --> 00:12:39,844
So, here you are, brother.

82
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:41,428
Rollo.

83
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:43,639
By Freyr and all the gods, how you've grown.

84
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:44,890
Hello, Rollo.

85
00:12:44,974 --> 00:12:48,060
Are you here for the thing?
You're a real man now.

86
00:12:48,561 --> 00:12:51,480
Come, let's get a drink.

87
00:12:59,697 --> 00:13:01,740
Looking a little pale, Bjorn.

88
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:05,536
Are you ready for a woman?

89
00:13:05,953 --> 00:13:10,082
There's some good-looking women in Kattegat.
Some of them are free.

90
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:14,837
Can't even grow a beard,
can you, boy?

91
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:19,466
Why don't you go lie down?

92
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:28,559
So where do you think
the Earl is going to send us this year?

93
00:13:29,393 --> 00:13:32,396
Those bastards to the east
are as poor as we are.

94
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:33,772
I know.

95
00:13:36,609 --> 00:13:38,944
That's why we should sail west.

96
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,405
I've heard such tales, Rollo.

97
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:44,366
Great towns and cities and treasures.

98
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:47,912
Hoards of gold and silver, and a new god.

99
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:51,665
I've heard those stories, too, but what does it mean?

100
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,418
We can't sail
across an open ocean.

101
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,298
I believe there's a way to go west.

102
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:06,805
I have something that will change everything.

103
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:09,683
What?

104
00:14:14,313 --> 00:14:16,273
What is that?
Now just listen.

105
00:14:16,607 --> 00:14:18,692
A while back, I met someone,

106
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:21,028
a wanderer.

107
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:24,448
He told me it was possible to go west,

108
00:14:24,782 --> 00:14:26,283
over the open sea,

109
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:28,744
using this.

110
00:14:32,665 --> 00:14:34,124
It's a sun board.

111
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:37,378
It needs to sit in water.

112
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:39,463
Another wanderer?

113
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:40,798
This time, it's different.

114
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:43,550
Now tell me, Ragnar,
this wanderer of yours,

115
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:45,302
has he ever
sailed west himself?

116
00:14:45,386 --> 00:14:46,971
Just get some water.

117
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:03,320
Now, this candle is the sun.

118
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:08,784
Every day, the sun rises up into the sky until noon.

119
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:10,661
See how the shadow shortens?

120
00:15:11,412 --> 00:15:13,914
At noon, it is at its shortest.

121
00:15:13,998 --> 00:15:15,666
That only tells me how far south I have traveled.

122
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:18,127
Didn't I just
tell you to listen?

123
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:23,716
The day before sailing,
you mark a circle around the pointer

124
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:26,552
where the shadow
is at its shortest at noon.

125
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:28,595
The next day at sea,

126
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:31,765
you place the board back into water around noon

127
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:33,392
and watch the shadow.

128
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:37,229
If the shadow
only touches the circle...

129
00:15:37,438 --> 00:15:39,064
Your course remains true?

130
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:40,190
Yes.

131
00:15:40,441 --> 00:15:43,694
And if it passes outside the circle, like this...

132
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:48,615
Then you have drifted, and you must steer further south.

133
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:49,908
Yes.

134
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:52,786
And what if it never reaches the circle?

135
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,956
Then you are too far south,
and must steer more to the north.

136
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,541
That's it!

137
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:01,754
Keep the noon shadow
on the circle,

138
00:16:01,837 --> 00:16:03,547
and your course will be true.

139
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,215
West.

140
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:13,015
But what if there is no sun?

141
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:15,267
How can the board
help you then?

142
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:17,394
How could you find your way?

143
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:23,484
Using this.

144
00:16:28,614 --> 00:16:30,074
Follow me outside.

145
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:37,331
They call it a sunstone.

146
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:42,795
You see?

147
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:45,631
There is the sun.

148
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:47,633
Now we go west.

149
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,887
Come on. Come on.

150
00:17:08,112 --> 00:17:09,696
Silence!

151
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,615
Silence!

152
00:17:30,926 --> 00:17:36,056
Olaf Anwend,
you have pleaded guilty to the charge of stealing.

153
00:17:36,515 --> 00:17:38,809
Tomorrow, you will run a gauntlet of stones

154
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:40,936
and turf as punishment.

155
00:17:42,146 --> 00:17:44,898
Yes, Lord.
Thank you, Lord.

156
00:17:44,982 --> 00:17:47,401
Let it be known,
a fine is to be paid

157
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:51,738
by anyone who fails to throw something.

158
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:55,868
Bring in the next accused.

159
00:17:57,995 --> 00:18:00,164
- There he is!
- Murderer!

160
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:01,999
Burn him!

161
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:06,628
Eric Trygvasson, you are accused of the murder

162
00:18:06,712 --> 00:18:09,965
of Sigvald Strut this January.

163
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:12,092
How do you plead?

164
00:18:12,176 --> 00:18:15,262
It wasn't murder, Lord.
I killed him in self-defense.

165
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:17,055
Liar!

166
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:19,850
If it wasn't murder,

167
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,476
why did you not
declare your crime

168
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,896
to the first person
that you met afterwards,

169
00:18:23,979 --> 00:18:25,981
as the law obliges?

170
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:31,987
In fact, you passed by several houses
before you reported it.

171
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:35,532
I thought the relatives of the dead man
might be living in them.

172
00:18:38,202 --> 00:18:43,207
The law allows you to pass two houses,
in such circumstances,

173
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:44,875
but never a third.

174
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,960
You murdered my brother in cold blood!

175
00:18:47,044 --> 00:18:49,087
It's not true!

176
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:53,217
We argued about some disputed land.
He pulled out a knife!

177
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,385
You wanted that land for yourself!

178
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:58,722
You're a liar and a coward.

179
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:01,683
Who says I'm a coward?
I'm not a coward.

180
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:04,102
Silence!

181
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:08,398
As the normal procedures
were not followed,

182
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:11,235
this killing
cannot be atoned for

183
00:19:12,069 --> 00:19:14,363
by compensating
the victim's family.

184
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:18,408
Murder is a dishonorable deed
amongst our people.

185
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:22,454
Carried out in secret,
unacknowledged,

186
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,333
and likely to give rise to a series of revenge killings

187
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:29,378
that would involve
your own family.

188
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:33,090
Lord, you knew about that land.

189
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:36,385
You knew I had a claim to it...
Enough!

190
00:19:37,386 --> 00:19:40,013
I ask you to look to the accused.

191
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:43,475
If you think that he is guilty,

192
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:45,769
raise your arms.

193
00:19:59,283 --> 00:20:01,618
The decision must be unanimous.

194
00:20:12,796 --> 00:20:14,131
Eric Trygvasson,

195
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:17,843
you have been found
guilty of murder.

196
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:20,095
- Yes!
- Justice!

197
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,139
How do you wish to die?

198
00:20:24,516 --> 00:20:26,351
By beheading, Lord.

199
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:31,440
Your wish is granted.
You shall be executed tomorrow.

200
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:36,862
After which we shall feast
and talk about the summer raids.

201
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:58,342
You have to.

202
00:21:38,632 --> 00:21:41,343
Why is he smiling,
Father?

203
00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:44,888
He wants to die well,
without fear,

204
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:47,391
to atone for his sins.

205
00:21:57,776 --> 00:22:00,612
You must watch, for his sake.

206
00:22:01,113 --> 00:22:04,074
It's his only hope
of reaching Valhalla.

207
00:22:19,923 --> 00:22:21,550
Feed him to your pigs!

208
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:26,805
And I curse him.

209
00:22:27,597 --> 00:22:29,641
May he never enter Valhalla.

210
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,228
May he never feast
with the gods.

211
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:39,943
Why did he do that?

212
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:42,028
He should not have done that.

213
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:45,157
Someone told me he wanted that land for himself,

214
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,033
and he knew Trygvasson
had the best claim to it,

215
00:22:47,117 --> 00:22:48,785
but refused to sell it.

216
00:22:51,204 --> 00:22:55,083
You hear that, boy?
This is how things are done around here.

217
00:22:57,794 --> 00:23:00,046
Olaf, son of Ingolf,

218
00:23:00,297 --> 00:23:02,257
Bjorn, son of Ragnar,

219
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:07,053
may you accept this
gift of salt and earth

220
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:13,059
to remind yourself
that you belong to both the land and the sea.

221
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:26,281
These arm rings bind you in loyalty to me,
your lord, your chieftain.

222
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,328
Any oath that you swear on these rings
must be honored and kept.

223
00:23:31,995 --> 00:23:33,747
Do you understand
and swear to this?

224
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,332
Yes, Lord.
Yes, Lord.

225
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:39,503
And do you freely give your fealty to me,
your lord, your chieftain?

226
00:23:39,794 --> 00:23:41,338
Yes, Lord.
Yes, Lord.

227
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:47,344
Good. You may put
on the arm rings.

228
00:23:53,934 --> 00:23:55,477
Come here.

229
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,046
Let us feast!

230
00:24:23,213 --> 00:24:24,464
My Lord,

231
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:27,676
we all want to feast,

232
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:31,721
but we also want to know
where we will be raiding this summer.

233
00:24:32,597 --> 00:24:34,474
Can't it wait, Ragnar?

234
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:36,309
No. Tell us.

235
00:24:36,851 --> 00:24:38,228
We want to know.

236
00:24:38,937 --> 00:24:40,564
We have a right to know.

237
00:24:40,814 --> 00:24:42,065
Very well.

238
00:24:42,566 --> 00:24:47,112
We will raid east again, to the eastlands
and into Russia.

239
00:24:47,237 --> 00:24:48,697
Every year

240
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:51,783
we go to the same places!

241
00:24:55,579 --> 00:24:57,747
But there is an alternative,

242
00:25:00,584 --> 00:25:01,835
if you choose.

243
00:25:04,421 --> 00:25:07,841
Yes, yes. Choice, yes.

244
00:25:08,466 --> 00:25:12,178
I have heard of these rumors, these stories.

245
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:16,016
That if we travel west,
that we will somehow reach a land

246
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:17,976
that is rich and plentiful.

247
00:25:20,562 --> 00:25:25,317
But I tell you
that I will not risk my ships or my reputation

248
00:25:25,775 --> 00:25:27,902
on such a deluded fantasy.

249
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:32,616
They are my ships.
I pay for them.

250
00:25:32,907 --> 00:25:35,535
And they go
where I tell them to go.

251
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:38,079
Now that's the end
of the matter.

252
00:25:43,084 --> 00:25:44,377
Let's feast!

253
00:25:58,475 --> 00:26:00,101
Let me see!

254
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:04,064
It's a fine ring.

255
00:26:10,111 --> 00:26:11,988
Ragnar Lothbrok,

256
00:26:12,989 --> 00:26:16,826
Earl Haraldson wants to speak with you in private.

257
00:26:19,663 --> 00:26:21,289
Stay with your uncle.

258
00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:35,845
Ragnar Lothbrok.

259
00:26:39,349 --> 00:26:40,558
Sit down.

260
00:26:46,314 --> 00:26:48,149
Are you hungry?

261
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:50,902
Yes, Lord.

262
00:26:55,865 --> 00:26:57,867
You want to feast in my hall?

263
00:26:58,243 --> 00:27:00,787
You want to sail
in my ships?

264
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,789
Anything else you want from me?

265
00:27:04,207 --> 00:27:05,250
Lord...

266
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:08,044
You keep talking
about the west.

267
00:27:08,545 --> 00:27:10,380
What do you know of it? Hmm?

268
00:27:11,506 --> 00:27:15,510
Why are you so certain
that it's a land of great riches?

269
00:27:16,386 --> 00:27:17,762
I can't be sure.

270
00:27:19,055 --> 00:27:20,181
But I believe that...

271
00:27:20,265 --> 00:27:22,183
I don't care what you believe.

272
00:27:22,892 --> 00:27:25,228
You insulted me out there,

273
00:27:26,104 --> 00:27:28,148
and not for the first time,

274
00:27:29,065 --> 00:27:32,819
but, believe me,
it will be the last.

275
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:41,411
Who told you you could go?

276
00:27:48,835 --> 00:27:51,421
You are a farmer.

277
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:55,592
You should be content
with your lot.

278
00:27:57,385 --> 00:28:00,430
Farms are few
and in great demand,

279
00:28:02,098 --> 00:28:04,225
and there are many people here

280
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:06,811
who would like
to possess your land.

281
00:28:09,606 --> 00:28:12,108
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

282
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:15,111
I understand.

283
00:28:16,863 --> 00:28:20,617
Then don't ever stick your nose in my face again.

284
00:28:34,797 --> 00:28:37,467
I don't trust him.
Watch him.

285
00:28:41,596 --> 00:28:43,973
Where are we
going now? I'm so tired.

286
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,475
To talk to the gods.

287
00:28:47,435 --> 00:28:48,895
It's what we do.

288
00:28:59,906 --> 00:29:02,325
Why don't you come in?
I'm waiting.

289
00:29:08,957 --> 00:29:10,166
Sit.

290
00:29:15,922 --> 00:29:17,423
What do you want?

291
00:29:18,258 --> 00:29:20,885
I want to know what the gods have in store.

292
00:29:22,095 --> 00:29:25,139
For you, or for the boy?

293
00:29:26,349 --> 00:29:28,935
I'm more interested in myself.

294
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:34,190
The gods desire you to have a great future.
I see that.

295
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:39,112
But they can withdraw
their goodwill at any time.

296
00:29:40,029 --> 00:29:42,532
To have this great future,

297
00:29:43,199 --> 00:29:44,951
must I challenge the law?

298
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:50,290
You must convince
the gods to alter the runes

299
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:54,002
so they work in your favor.

300
00:29:54,711 --> 00:29:56,921
But the laws of men

301
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:01,884
are far below the workings
and shapings of the gods.

302
00:30:04,721 --> 00:30:07,390
So I should take
the laws of men

303
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:09,851
into my own hands?

304
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,440
Answer me.

305
00:30:15,815 --> 00:30:17,942
You already have your answer.

306
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:20,653
No, I don't.

307
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:25,033
Well, then go and ask the gods yourself.

308
00:30:25,116 --> 00:30:27,118
What are you afraid of?

309
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:36,044
Wait outside.

310
00:30:36,127 --> 00:30:37,503
All right.

311
00:30:38,796 --> 00:30:41,883
You haven't helped me
at all, ancient one.

312
00:30:45,428 --> 00:30:47,972
Perhaps you asked
the wrong questions.

313
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:08,534
Where are they?

314
00:31:08,618 --> 00:31:09,911
Where are my sons?

315
00:31:09,994 --> 00:31:11,412
You said you'd found them.

316
00:32:06,092 --> 00:32:08,219
We have someone
special to visit.

317
00:32:08,302 --> 00:32:10,263
His name is Floki.

318
00:32:10,346 --> 00:32:11,514
"Floki"?

319
00:32:12,014 --> 00:32:13,975
Like Loki, the god?

320
00:32:14,726 --> 00:32:17,603
Yes, only different.

321
00:32:18,271 --> 00:32:20,106
How is he different?

322
00:32:20,189 --> 00:32:21,774
He's not a god.

323
00:32:22,567 --> 00:32:25,278
Why didn't he come
to the thing?

324
00:32:25,361 --> 00:32:26,696
Because...

325
00:32:28,156 --> 00:32:29,699
Because he's shy.

326
00:32:36,289 --> 00:32:39,375
Floki, this is my son, Bjorn.

327
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:42,587
Hello. How are you?

328
00:32:43,129 --> 00:32:45,339
Well. Thank you, sir.

329
00:32:46,674 --> 00:32:47,884
Let me see.

330
00:32:51,637 --> 00:32:53,890
You have your father's eyes

331
00:32:54,474 --> 00:32:56,100
unfortunately.

332
00:32:57,101 --> 00:32:58,811
Why unfortunately?

333
00:32:59,145 --> 00:33:01,272
It means he will be like you,

334
00:33:01,355 --> 00:33:04,108
and therefore he will want to do better than you,

335
00:33:04,192 --> 00:33:06,194
and you will hate him for it.

336
00:33:09,113 --> 00:33:12,074
How can you tell that by just looking at my face?

337
00:33:12,158 --> 00:33:14,160
It's the same with trees.

338
00:33:14,243 --> 00:33:16,078
I can tell
which trees will make

339
00:33:16,162 --> 00:33:18,581
the best planks
just by looking at them.

340
00:33:19,248 --> 00:33:22,251
I can look
inside the tree.

341
00:33:23,503 --> 00:33:25,421
Floki is a boat-builder.

342
00:33:25,797 --> 00:33:27,465
Among other things.

343
00:33:58,996 --> 00:34:00,456
This is one.

344
00:34:01,624 --> 00:34:04,460
Inside this tree are two almost perfect planks.

345
00:34:04,544 --> 00:34:06,796
They will bend, then curve,

346
00:34:06,879 --> 00:34:09,507
like a woman's body from the thighs to the back.

347
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:13,302
When I split this tree,
I will find them.

348
00:34:15,346 --> 00:34:17,265
You can see that?

349
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,686
Do you think I'm joking?

350
00:34:32,655 --> 00:34:37,243
I joke about many things, son of Ragnar,

351
00:34:37,326 --> 00:34:39,704
but never about ship-building.

352
00:34:40,663 --> 00:34:44,000
Do you imagine ships are just dead things?

353
00:34:44,709 --> 00:34:47,837
So, what about our boat?

354
00:34:52,133 --> 00:34:54,427
It will be lighter
and carry a bigger sail.

355
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,845
The construction is different.

356
00:34:55,928 --> 00:34:57,889
It's built with a strong central plank.

357
00:34:57,972 --> 00:34:59,599
The two strakes
above it are nailed

358
00:34:59,682 --> 00:35:00,933
directly onto
the knees of the frame.

359
00:35:01,017 --> 00:35:02,935
But the ones below... Look!

360
00:35:03,019 --> 00:35:05,771
Are cleated and lashed onto the frames, not nailed,

361
00:35:05,855 --> 00:35:07,940
so they can move
in relation to each other.

362
00:35:08,024 --> 00:35:11,068
This means the boat
won't butt against the waves like a goat,

363
00:35:11,152 --> 00:35:13,195
but move over them
like a ripple.

364
00:35:14,113 --> 00:35:16,616
The hull is deeper.
How will my men set their oars?

365
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:18,618
I will cut them
into the sheerstrakes,

366
00:35:18,701 --> 00:35:21,037
and the ports can be closed
when the boat is at sea.

367
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,997
And you think it could handle long sea voyages?

368
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,708
That's why
I'm building it.

369
00:35:29,045 --> 00:35:31,047
But will it be strong enough?

370
00:35:31,881 --> 00:35:33,966
We won't know
that until we try.

371
00:35:40,389 --> 00:35:42,308
When will it be ready?

372
00:35:44,018 --> 00:35:45,895
As to that...

373
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,481
What?

374
00:35:49,774 --> 00:35:51,359
We're out of money.

375
00:35:52,568 --> 00:35:55,821
We have to pay for the sail
and then the anchor.

376
00:35:55,905 --> 00:35:59,909
I know what those blacksmiths
are like, greedy bastards.

377
00:36:00,368 --> 00:36:01,827
For the anchor.

378
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:05,831
It's all I have left
from last summer's raids.

379
00:36:05,915 --> 00:36:07,375
Don't worry.

380
00:36:07,667 --> 00:36:10,586
We'll soon be
as rich as dwarves!

381
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:21,847
I missed you.

382
00:36:30,106 --> 00:36:32,858
Did anything happen
while we were away?

383
00:36:35,444 --> 00:36:36,696
No.

384
00:36:41,325 --> 00:36:43,786
Did you miss me?

385
00:36:49,458 --> 00:36:51,877
I ached with love longing.

386
00:36:53,462 --> 00:36:56,090
My belly was empty
of laughter.

387
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:59,427
Is that what you want? Hmm?

388
00:37:04,306 --> 00:37:06,225
You want me to make you laugh?

389
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:10,229
I don't want to laugh now.

390
00:37:13,149 --> 00:37:15,359
I want to ride you,

391
00:37:16,819 --> 00:37:17,987
like a bull.

392
00:37:21,198 --> 00:37:23,492
Like a wild bull.

393
00:37:50,227 --> 00:37:52,021
Hello, young Bjorn.

394
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,939
Hello, Rollo.

395
00:37:54,023 --> 00:37:55,649
Where are your parents?

396
00:37:56,233 --> 00:37:58,319
They are having sex.

397
00:38:02,031 --> 00:38:03,532
Well...

398
00:38:04,992 --> 00:38:07,203
I guess we'll have to wait.

399
00:38:21,258 --> 00:38:23,135
So, Gyda,

400
00:38:23,928 --> 00:38:26,472
is your mother teaching you how to use a shield?

401
00:38:26,555 --> 00:38:28,933
Yes, I know
how to use a shield.

402
00:38:29,892 --> 00:38:32,144
Your mother was a famous shield-maiden.

403
00:38:32,478 --> 00:38:33,479
"Was"?

404
00:38:33,562 --> 00:38:35,231
Is a famous shield-maiden.

405
00:38:35,314 --> 00:38:37,274
We fought in
the same shield wall

406
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:39,985
against the eastlanders.

407
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:44,782
She fought like a valkyrie.

408
00:38:49,912 --> 00:38:51,497
Come on,
children, to bed.

409
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,832
Let's leave the men.

410
00:38:52,915 --> 00:38:54,959
But I'm a man.
I have a ring.

411
00:38:55,417 --> 00:38:57,211
Let him stay awhile.

412
00:38:57,294 --> 00:38:58,629
To bed!

413
00:39:01,465 --> 00:39:02,883
Say good night.

414
00:39:02,967 --> 00:39:04,510
Good night, my children.

415
00:39:04,593 --> 00:39:06,303
- Good night.
- Good night.

416
00:39:06,387 --> 00:39:07,680
Good night.
Good night.

417
00:39:07,763 --> 00:39:09,014
Hey!

418
00:39:18,607 --> 00:39:20,609
Good night, Father.

419
00:39:22,653 --> 00:39:24,405
Tell me your news.

420
00:39:24,947 --> 00:39:26,448
What about the boat?

421
00:39:26,991 --> 00:39:28,701
It's nearly ready.

422
00:39:32,955 --> 00:39:35,040
Do you trust Floki?

423
00:39:35,958 --> 00:39:37,626
Isn't he a great joker?

424
00:39:38,502 --> 00:39:42,756
He's a great boat builder.
I trust him to do that.

425
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:47,720
I won't go
under your command.

426
00:39:50,764 --> 00:39:53,183
I won't go
unless we're all equal.

427
00:39:54,101 --> 00:39:55,978
We are brothers.

428
00:39:57,897 --> 00:40:00,274
You and I will always be equal.

429
00:40:06,822 --> 00:40:08,657
Then we must find a crew.

430
00:40:09,283 --> 00:40:12,328
Not many men will go against the wishes of Haraldson.

431
00:40:14,246 --> 00:40:15,998
Many will be afraid.

432
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:20,377
Some may even go
to him and betray us.

433
00:40:23,505 --> 00:40:25,174
I must go piss.

434
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,626
Yesterday, I was with a girl from the town.

435
00:41:00,709 --> 00:41:01,794
Thank you.

436
00:41:02,544 --> 00:41:04,421
A good-looking girl, too.

437
00:41:10,052 --> 00:41:12,554
But when she shouted out in pleasure,

438
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:16,183
I didn't see her face.

439
00:41:18,602 --> 00:41:20,396
I saw yours.

440
00:41:22,898 --> 00:41:24,233
Lagertha...

441
00:41:25,901 --> 00:41:27,736
Don't talk like that.

442
00:41:27,903 --> 00:41:29,113
Why not?

443
00:41:31,573 --> 00:41:33,534
I think about you all the time.

444
00:41:34,785 --> 00:41:36,537
That's too bad.

445
00:41:38,414 --> 00:41:40,416
Don't insult me, shield-maiden.

446
00:41:40,958 --> 00:41:42,167
No.

447
00:41:42,251 --> 00:41:44,545
I would never insult you.

448
00:41:44,628 --> 00:41:47,131
You're too great a warrior,

449
00:41:50,676 --> 00:41:53,679
but perhaps not so great a man.

450
00:42:29,548 --> 00:42:31,091
I saw something.

451
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:33,552
What did you see?

452
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,680
A sign.

453
00:42:39,058 --> 00:42:41,810
It made me certain we're doing the right thing.

454
00:42:50,027 --> 00:42:51,695
Good night, brother.

455
00:43:17,805 --> 00:43:20,682
It's...
No need to say.

456
00:43:20,766 --> 00:43:23,852
I see it in your eyes.

457
00:43:24,561 --> 00:43:25,562
Beautiful.

458
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:34,154
It's only beautiful
if it works.

459
00:43:51,922 --> 00:43:53,340
Set the sail.

460
00:43:54,967 --> 00:43:57,302
Floki! The sail!

461
00:43:58,053 --> 00:43:59,304
She'll sink.

462
00:43:59,388 --> 00:44:00,806
No, she bloody won't.

463
00:44:00,889 --> 00:44:03,725
I shouldn't have pretended to build such a boat.

464
00:44:03,892 --> 00:44:06,103
It's beyond
my humble capabilities.

465
00:44:07,855 --> 00:44:09,231
I'll set the sail.

466
00:44:09,982 --> 00:44:11,400
I'm sorry, Ragnar.

467
00:44:11,692 --> 00:44:13,944
I've wasted all your money.
It was all a joke.

468
00:44:14,027 --> 00:44:15,737
Shut up, man.

469
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:39,803
Ha!

470
00:44:45,267 --> 00:44:47,436
Now it runs on its cool keel.

471
00:44:47,603 --> 00:44:48,979
It's beautiful.

472
00:44:49,605 --> 00:44:53,483
Why didn't you believe me?
I told you I could do it!

473
00:44:58,071 --> 00:45:01,783
Now it's all up to you,
Ragnar Lothbrok.
